This is a repository of Jupyter Notebooks to run numerical analysis for past Tripos questions to deepen understanding of Engineering Tripos Part IB content. 

So far, it contains mostly question from 2P6 (Information engineering) but may change in the future. 

Make sure to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jyucam/Part_IB_Tripos_Question_Simulations/wiki) to check out all of the questions with an associated Jupyter Notebook!
